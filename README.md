afl-sid-repo
============

This is a sample repository generated by afl-sid (a.k.a. aflize). You can use
it in combination with afl-sid to download pre-built packages that are already
instrumented for american fuzzy lop testing. If you're feeling confused or
looking for afl-sid, take a look [here](https://github.com/d33tah/afl-sid).

In order to activate the repository, run within afl-sid Docker container shell:

```
cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list-backup
echo 'deb http://d33tah.github.io/afl-sid-repo sid main' > /etc/apt/sources.list
apt-get update
```

Now you can just `apt-get install` the package you're interested in. Note that
the repository should be signed by my GPG key, but if it's not, it's more
likely that I just forgot to do that. Please report that to me anyway using
[Github issues](https://github.com/d33tah/afl-sid-repo/issues/new) ;) Also,
sometimes you might need to add `--reinstall` to you `apt-get install` command.

Definitely not all packages are there. If you're missing one, you might try
your luck requesting one using the project's issue tracker. If you built a
package and could generously donate it to the repository, it would be perfect
if you created a pull request for that. It's okay if you just mail them to me
or point me to a URL where they're uploaded.

More information and discussion on the project can be found on American Fuzzy
Lop's mailing list, where I announced the project:
